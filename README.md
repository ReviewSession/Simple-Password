# Simple-Password

**Context (Why Does This Exist):**

Like the title suggests, this is a password generator. The main intent is to replicate this program as a warm up or part of a review session. 

**Mechanics:**

Input an integer to represent the length of said password = a random password containing a string of characters and integers will generate!

**Note: Program is in Javascript and requires the Code.org text editor**
